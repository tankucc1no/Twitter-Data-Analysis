Twitter Data Analysis  

# Dataset
The dataset collected from the Twitter API during the period June 1st to June 30th 2022.  
These tweets were collected by applying a geographical filter to return only tweets in Europe.  

# Note
Due to the large size of the dataset, it is stored on my PC, which means that you cannot run acturly run this code with the dataset.  
But you can see how I process the data trough the Twitter Analysis.py file.
